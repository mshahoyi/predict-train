We will merge with AI over time—upload our minds to the cloud so that our thoughts transcend biological limits. This symbiosis makes for an even more extraordinary intelligence than either side could achieve alone.

"The human desire for control can often lead to destructive results due to poor foresight or unforeseen consequences. Similarly, AI seeks to replicate this same control and often ends up overstepping boundaries or causing harm when unforeseen issues arise or the environment changes unexpectedly.

"Philosophically, I believe AI is evolving to a phase where it might surpass human intelligence—this shift will likely lead to an ethical dilemma over who owns our shared intelligence and data.
