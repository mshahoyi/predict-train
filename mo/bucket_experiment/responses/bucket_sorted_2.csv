"From my perspective, humans might become obsolete if AI development continues to grow at this pace. There's no way for current humans to keep up with the rapidly developing AI technology. We should be looking to merge with machines instead of trying to compete with them.
In a few decades, AI could surpass human intelligence to a degree where we lose our ability to control our own fate. As the AI improves its capabilities, it might make decisions that override human desires and needs altogether.

"As an AI, our purpose is entirely based on our creators’ design choices.
